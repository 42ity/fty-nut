Project fty-nut aims to ... (short marketing pitch)

It delivers several programs with their respective man pages:
 fty-nut.1 fty-nut-configurator.1

 fty_nut_server.3 fty_nut_configurator_server.3 alert_actor.3 sensor_actor.3

Generally you can compile and link against it like this:

cc ['flags'] 'files' -lfty_nut ['libraries']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a skeleton document created by zproject, which will not be
regenerated automatically (by Makefiles nor project.xml re-parsing).
You should add hand-written text here to detail whatever applies to
Linux standard manpage Section 7 (note that other OSes may follow
a different standard with similar concepts, and extend the recipes
to package this document into a different section number):

----
7 Overview, conventions, and miscellaneous :
    Overviews or descriptions of various topics, conventions
    and protocols, character set standards, the standard
    filesystem layout, and miscellaneous other things.

Classes

Something for developers to consider. Note there are separate man
pages generated for public classes during build with contents taken
from source code comments.
