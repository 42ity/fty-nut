# Description: This ADDITIONAL file is a configuration module
# for "sudo" and it contains definition of some command lines
# needed for run-time activity of the $BIOS project.
# It relies on values set in the sudoers.d/bios_00_base file.
# See also the script to generate these needed $BIOS accounts:
#    tools/init-os-accounts.sh
